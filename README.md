THIS WILL TEACH YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE ALMIGHTY CHERISE!
Class project week one of Code Fellows 201

Hello my name is Cherise and I am learning to become a coder. I love doing this type of work and really feel that I have found my calling. I have two daughters, 20 and 21; and a grandaughter who is 3 months. Being a grandma is very fullfilling and I never knew that it was possible to love another person as much as I love her. 

I have attended school basically my entire life and enjoy learning and having a variety of skills and a divese bank of knowledge. I have gone to school for automotivre, psychology, project management, and I have an AA in business, and now coding. I have always believed that continuous learning keeps the brain healthy.

I plan on taking what I learn here and going into a new and exciting career in the coding field. I have always had a dream of ending up at Apple. I love the Apple brand and admire Steve Jobs for the amazing innovations that he hass given to the field of technology. I would love to be a part of the his vision.
